	abstract = {In this paper, we survey recent approaches to blue-noise sampling and discuss their beneficial applications. We discuss the sampling algorithms that use points as sampling primitives and classify the sampling algorithms based on various aspects, e.g., the sampling domain and the type of algorithm. We demonstrate several well-known applications that can be improved by recent blue-noise sampling techniques, as well as some new applications such as dynamic sampling and blue-noise remeshing.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a simple yet efficient algorithm for triangulating a 2D input domain containing a Poisson-disk sampled point set. The proposed algorithm combines a regular grid and a discrete clustering approach to speedup the triangulation. Moreover, our triangulation algorithm is flexible and performs well on more general point sets such as adaptive, non-maximal Poisson-disk sets. The experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm is robust for a wide range of input domains and achieves significant performance improvement compared to the current state-of-the-art approaches. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

In this paper, we study the problem of maximal Poisson-disk sampling on mesh surfaces. We present a simple approach that generalizes the 2D maximal sampling framework to surfaces. The key observation is to use a subdivided mesh as the sampling domain for conflict checking and void detection. Our approach improves the state-of-the-art approach in efficiency, quality and the memory consumption.},

@article{sherman2020characterizing,
	abstract = {Abstract The topology of natural fracture networks is inherently linked to the structure of the fluid velocity field and transport therein. Here we study the impact of network density on flow and transport behaviors. We stochastically generate fracture networks of varying density and simulate flow and transport with a discrete fracture network model, which fully resolves network topology at the fracture scale. We study conservative solute trajectories with Lagrangian particle tracking and find that as fracture density decreases, solute channelization to large local fractures increases, thereby reducing plume spreading. Furthermore, in sparse networks mean particle travel distance increases and local network features, such as velocity zones where flow is counter to the primary pressure gradient, become increasingly important for transport. As the network density increases, network statistics homogenize and such local features have a reduced impact. We quantify local topological influence on transport behavior with an effective tortuosity parameter, which measures the ratio of total advective distance to linear distance at the fracture scale; large tortuosity values are correlated to slow-velocity regions. These large tortuosity, slow-velocity regions delay downstream transport and enhance tailing on particle breakthrough curves. Finally, we predict transport with an upscaled, Bernoulli spatial Markov random walk model and parameterize local topological influences with a novel tortuosity parameter. Bernoulli model predictions improve when sampling from a tortuosity distribution, as opposed to a fixed value as has previously been done, suggesting that local network topological features must be carefully considered in upscaled modeling efforts of fracture network systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract We develop a theoretical model for power law tailing behavior of transport in fractured rock based on the relative dominance of the decay rate of the advective travel time distribution, modeled using a Pareto distribution (with tail decaying as ∼ time−(1+α)), versus matrix diffusion, modeled using a L{\'e}vy distribution. The theory predicts that when the advective travel time distribution decays sufficiently slowly (α<1), the late-time decay rate of the breakthrough curve is −(1+α/2) rather than the classical −3/2. However, if α>1, the −3/2 decay rate is recovered. For weak matrix diffusion or short advective first breakthrough times, we identify an early-time regime where the breakthrough curve follows the Pareto distribution, before transitioning to the late-time decay rate. The theoretical predictions are validated against particle tracking simulations in the three-dimensional discrete fracture network simulator dfnWorks, where matrix diffusion is incorporated using a time domain random walk.},

	abstract = {Abstract We investigate the relative impact of topological, geometric, and hydraulic heterogeneity on transport processes in three-dimensional fracture networks. Focusing on the two largest scales of heterogeneity in these systems, individual fracture and network structure, we compare transport through analogous structured and disordered three-dimensional fracture networks with varying degrees of hydraulic heterogeneity. For the moderate levels of hydraulic heterogeneity we consider, network structure is the dominant control of transport through the networks. Less dispersion, both longitudinal and transverse, is observed in structured networks than in disordered networks, due in part to the higher connectivity in the former, independent of the level of hydraulic heterogeneity. However, increases in dispersion with higher hydraulic heterogeneity are larger in the disordered networks than in the structured networks, thereby indicating that the interplay between structural and hydraulic heterogeneity is nonlinear. We propose a measure of disorder in fracture networks by computing the Shannon entropy of the spectrum of the Laplacian of a weighted graph representation of the networks, where the weights are given by a combination of topological, geometric, and hydraulic properties. This metric, as a relative indicator by comparison between two networks, is a first approach to the dispersion potential and ``mixing capacity'' of a fracture network.},

	abstractnote = {Fracture and fragmentation are extremely nonlinear multiscale processes in which microscale damage mechanisms emerge at the macroscale as new fracture surfaces. Numerous numerical methods have been developed for simulating fracture initiation, propagation, and coalescence. In this paper, we present a computational approach for modeling pervasive fracture in quasi-brittle materials based on random close-packed Voronoi tessellations. Each Voronoi cell is formulated as a polyhedral finite element containing an arbitrary number of vertices and faces. Fracture surfaces are allowed to nucleate only at the intercell faces. Cohesive softening tractions are applied to new fracture surfaces in order to model the energy dissipated during fracture growth. The randomly seeded Voronoi cells provide a regularized discrete random network for representing fracture surfaces. The potential crack paths within the random network are viewed as instances of realizable crack paths within the continuum material. Mesh convergence of fracture simulations is viewed in a weak, or distributional, sense. The explicit facet representation of fractures within this approach is advantageous for modeling contact on new fracture surfaces and fluid flow within the evolving fracture network. Finally, applications of interest include fracture and fragmentation in quasi-brittle materials and geomechanical applications such as hydraulic fracturing, engineered geothermal systems, compressed-air energy storage, and carbon sequestration.},

@article{MDS_good_trig1,
	abstract = {We present a Conforming Delaunay Triangulation (CDT) algorithm based on maximal Poisson disk sampling. Points are unbiased, meaning the probability of introducing a vertex in a disk-free subregion is proportional to its area, except in a neighborhood of the domain boundary. In contrast, Delaunay refinement CDT algorithms place points dependent on the geometry of empty circles in intermediate triangulations, usually near the circle centers. Unconstrained angles in our mesh are between 30$\,^{\circ}$ and 120$\,^{\circ}$, matching some biased CDT methods. Points are placed on the boundary using a one-dimensional maximal Poisson disk sampling. Any triangulation method producing angles bounded away from 0$\,^{\circ}$ and 180$\,^{\circ}$ must have some bias near the domain boundary to avoid placing vertices infinitesimally close to the boundary. Random meshes are preferred for some simulations, such as fracture simulations where cracks must follow mesh edges, because deterministic meshes may introduce non-physical phenomena. An ensemble of random meshes aids simulation validation. Poisson-disk triangulations also avoid some graphics rendering artifacts, and have the blue-noise property. We mesh two-dimensional domains that may be non-convex with holes, required points, and multiple regions in contact. Our algorithm is also fast and uses little memory. We have recently developed a method for generating a maximal Poisson distribution of n output points, where n=Θ(Area/r2) and r is the sampling radius. It takes O(n) memory and O(nlogn) expected time; in practice the time is nearly linear. This, or a similar subroutine, generates our random points. Except for this subroutine, we provably use O(n) time and space. The subroutine gives the location of points in a square background mesh. Given this, the neighborhood of each point can be meshed independently in constant time. These features facilitate parallel and GPU implementations. Our implementation works well in practice as illustrated by several examples and comparison to Triangle.},

To our knowledge this is the first provably correct algorithm with time and space dependent only on the number of points produced. Our method has two phases, both based on classical dart-throwing. The first phase uses a background grid of square cells to rapidly create an unbiased, near-maximal covering of the domain. The second phase completes the maximal covering by calculating the connected components of the remaining uncovered voids, and by using their geometry to efficiently place unbiased samples that cover them. The second phase converges quickly, overcoming a common difficulty in dart-throwing methods. The deterministic memory is O(n) and the expected running time is O(n log n), where n is the output size, the number of points in the final sample. Our serial implementation verifies that the log n dependence is minor, and nearly O(n) performance for both time and memory is achieved in practice. We also present a parallel implementation on GPUs to demonstrate the parallel-friendly nature of our method, which achieves 2.4x the performance of our serial version.},

In this paper it is shown that these artifacts are not an inherent part of point sampling, but a consequence of using regularly spaced samples. If the samples occur at appropriate nonuniformly spaced locations, frequencies above the Nyquist limit do not alias, but instead appear as noise of the correct average intensity. This noise is much less objectionable to our visual system than aliasing. In ray tracing, the rays can be stochastically distributed to perform a Monte Carlo evaluation of integrals in the rendering equation. This is called distributed ray tracing and can be used to simulate motion blur, depth of field, penumbrae, gloss, and translucency.},

We also propose an efficient optimization strategy to protect the domain boundaries and to remove slivers to improve the meshing quality.

@article{matmesh,
	abstract = {Creating a mesh is the first step in a wide range of applications, including scientific computing and computer graphics. An unstructured simplex mesh requires a choice of meshpoints (vertex nodes) and a triangulation. We want to offer a short and simple Matlab code, described in more detail than usual, so the reader can experiment (and add to the code) knowing the underlying principles. We find the node locations by solving for equilibrium in a truss structure (using piecewise linear force-displacement relations) and reset the topology by the Delaunay algorithm. The geometry is described implicitly by its distance function. In addition to being much shorter and simpler than other meshing techniques, our algorithm typically produces meshes of very high quality. We discuss ways to improve the robustness and the performance, but our aim here is simplicity. Readers can download (and edit) the codes from http://math.mit.edu/~persson/mesh.},

	abstract = {{This book develops the basic mathematical theory of the finite element method, the most widely used technique for engineering design and analysis. This expanded second edition contains new chapters on additive Schwarz preconditioners and adaptive meshes. New exercises have also been added throughout. The book will be useful to mathematicians as well as engineers and physical scientists. It can be used for a course that provides an introduction to basic functional analysis, approximation theory, and numerical analysis, while building upon and applying basic techniques of real variable theory. Different course paths can be chosen, allowing the book to be used for courses designed for students with different interests.}},

@article{azis,
	abstract = {The finite element procedure consists in finding an approximate solution in the form of piecewise linear functions, piecewise quadratic, etc. For two-dimensional problems, one of the most frequently used approaches is to triangulate the domain and find the approximate solution which is linear, quadratic, etc., in every triangle. A condition which is considered essential is that the angle of every triangle, independent of its size, should not be small. In this paper it is shown that the minimum angle condition is not essential. What is essential is the fact that no angle is too close to 180⚬.},
