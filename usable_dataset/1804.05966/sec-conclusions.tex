We have considered when $f$-subgraph centrality measures induce collisions at different walk-classes in a graph; that is, when an $f$-subgraph centrality measure assigns identical scores to nodes that have different walk structures.
We settled two open questions about the cardinality of the set of entropic graphs, and the set of entropic values.
In particular, we exhibited an infinite family of graphs where subgraph centrality assigns identical scores to all nodes for two parameter values (Corollary~\ref{cor:cartesian-infinite});
furthermore, we constructed a separate infinite family of entropic graphs with entropic values $\beta_i$ that converge to zero (Corollary~\ref{cor:entropic-kks-general}), proving the set of all entropic values is infinite and has at least one limit point.
One consequence of this result is that no sub-entropic interval of the form $(0,\eps)$ exists.
It remains an open problem to determine whether there exists an interval $(a,b)$ that is sub-entropic for $\exp(\beta x)$.

The existence of graphs entropic with respect to $f(x) = \exp(x)$ raises the question of whether there exist $f$-entropic graphs for other functions $f$ commonly used to define centrality measures.
We resolve this question in the affirmative by exhibiting an infinite family of functions $f_i$ and graphs $G_i$ such that $G_i$ is $f_i$-entropic (Section~\ref{sec:infinite-tensor}).

Finally, we present conditions (Corollary~\ref{cor:pos-suff-condition} and Corollary~\ref{cor:walk-class-lin-sys}) that can prove the existence of a function $f$ inducing a collision at a set of walk-classes in a given graph $G$; that $G$ is $f$-entropic for some $f$; or that $G$ is sub-entropic for all $f$-subgraph centralities.
Each of these conditions can be efficiently evaluated in practice, and we use the first condition to exhibit an instance of an $f$-entropic graph with three walk-classes.
It remains an open question whether the sufficient condition in Corollary~\ref{cor:pos-suff-condition} is in fact a characterization of when nodes collide for some function $f$.
