\begin{abstract}

Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is essential for the functioning of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers, and its implementation is a very sophisticated process involving both quantum and classical hardware. Formulating and verifying the decomposition of logical operations into physical ones is a challenge in itself.
In this paper, we propose {\myFrameworkName}, a verification framework that can efficiently verify the formal correctness of stabilizer codes, arguably the most important class of QEC codes.
{\myFrameworkName} first comes with a concise language, {\langname},  where stabilizers are treated as a first-class object, to represent QEC programs.
Stabilizers are also used as predicates in our new assertion language, {\assnname}, as logical and arithmetic operations of stabilizers can be naturally defined.
We derive a sound quantum Hoare logic proof system with a set of inference rules for {\myFrameworkName} to efficiently reason about the correctness of QEC programs.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of {\myFrameworkName} with both theoretical complexity analysis and in-depth case studies of two well-known stabilizer QEC codes, the repetition code and the surface code.
