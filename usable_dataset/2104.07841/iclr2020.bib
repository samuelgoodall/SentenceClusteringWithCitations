	share micro-videos nowadays. The sheer volume of micro-videos available
	in social networks often undermines users' capability to choose the
	micro-videos that best fit their interests. Recommendation appear as a
	natural solution to this problem. However, existing video recommendation
	methods only consider the users' historical preferences on videos,
	without exploring any video contents. In this paper, we develop a novel
	latent genre aware micro-video recommendation model to solve the
	problem. First, we extract user-item interaction features, and auxiliary
	features describing both contextual and visual contents of micro-videos.
	Second, these features are fed into the neural recommendation model that
	simultaneously learns the latent genres of micro-videos and the optimal
	recommendation scores. Experiments on real-world dataset demonstrate the
	effectiveness and the efficiency of our proposed method compared with
	several state-of-the-art approaches.}},

  abstract             = {{Abundance of information in recent years has become a serious challenge
	for web users. Recommender systems (RSs) have been often utilized to
	alleviate this issue. RSs prune large information spaces to recommend
	the most relevant items to users by considering their preferences.
	Nonetheless, in situations where users or items have few opinions, the
	recommendations cannot be made properly. This notable shortcoming in
	practical RSs is called cold-start problem. In the present study, we
	propose a novel approach to address this problem by incorporating social
	networking features. Coined as enhanced content-based algorithm using
	social networking (ECSN), the proposed algorithm considers the submitted
	ratings of faculty mates and friends besides user's own preferences. The
	effectiveness of ECSN algorithm was evaluated by implementing it in
	MyExpert, a newly designed academic social network (ASN) for academics
	in Malaysia. Real feedbacks from live interactions of MyExpert users
	with the recommended items are recorded for 12 consecutive weeks in
	which four different algorithms, namely, random, collaborative,
	content-based, and ECSN were applied every three weeks. The empirical
	results show significant performance of ECSN in mitigating the
	cold-start problem besides improving the prediction accuracy of
	recommendations when compared with other studied recommender algorithms.}},

  abstract  = {Self-supervised learning, which learns by constructing artificial labels given only the input signals, has recently gained considerable attention for learning representations with unlabeled datasets, i.e., learning without any human-annotated supervision. In this paper, we show that such a technique can be used to significantly improve the model accuracy even under fully-labeled datasets. Our scheme trains the model to learn both original and self-supervised tasks, but is different from conventional multi-task learning frameworks that optimize the summation of their corresponding losses. Our main idea is to learn a single unified task with respect to the joint distribution of the original and self-supervised labels, i.e., we augment original labels via self-supervision. This simple, yet effective approach allows to train models easier by relaxing a certain invariant constraint during learning the original and self-supervised tasks simultaneously. It also enables an aggregated inference which combines the predictions from different augmentations to improve the prediction accuracy. Furthermore, we propose a novel knowledge transfer technique, which we refer to as self-distillation, that has the effect of the aggregated inference in a single (faster) inference. We demonstrate the large accuracy improvement and wide applicability of our framework on various fully-supervised settings, e.g., the few-shot and imbalanced classification scenarios.},
