In this paper, we formally describe the three challenges of mapping surface code on superconducting devices, and present a comprehensive synthesis framework to overcome these challenges. The proposed framework consists of three optimizations. First, we adopt a geometrical method to allocate data qubits which ensures the existence of shallow syndrome extraction circuit. The proposed data qubit layout optimization reduces the overhead of syndrome extraction and serves as a good initial point for following optimizations. Second, we only use bridge qubits enclosed by data qubits and reduce the number of bridge qubits by merging short path between data qubits. The proposed bridge qubit optimization reduces the probability of bridge qubit conflicts and further minimizes the syndrome extraction overhead.  Third, we propose an efficient heuristic to schedule syndrome extractions. Based on the proposed data qubit allocation, we devise a good initial schedule of syndrome extractions and further refine this schedule to minimize the total time needed by a complete surface code error detection cycle. Our experiments on mainsstream superconducting quantum architectures have demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed framework.
