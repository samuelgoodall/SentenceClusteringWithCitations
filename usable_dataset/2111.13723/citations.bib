 abstract = {An alternative to using a single forecasting method is to average the forecasts obtained from several methods. In this paper we investigate empirically the impact of the number and choice of forecasting methods on the accuracy of simple averages. It is concluded that the forecasting accuracy improves, and that the variability of accuracy among different combinations decreases, as the number of methods in the average increases. Thus, combining forecasts seems to be a reasonable practical alternative when, as is often the case, a "true" model of the data-generating process or a single "best" forecasting method cannot be or is not, for whatever reasons, identified.},

	abstract = {The Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant has spread quickly since first being identified. To better understand its epidemiological characteristics and impact, we utilize multiple datasets and comprehensive model-inference methods to reconstruct COVID-19 pandemic dynamics in India, where Delta first emerged. Using model-inference estimates from March 2020 to May 2021, we estimate the Delta variant can escape adaptive immunity induced by prior wildtype infection roughly half of the time and is around 60\% more infectious than wildtype SARS-CoV-2. In addition, our analysis suggests that the recent case decline in India was likely due to implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions and weather conditions less conducive for SARS-CoV-2 transmission during March {\textendash} May, rather than high population immunity. Model projections show infections could resurge as India enters its monsoon season, beginning June, if intervention measures are lifted prematurely.Competing Interest StatementJS and Columbia University disclose partial ownership of SK Analytics.
