\section{Conclusion}

Quantum error correction is the bedrock of fault-tolerant quantum computation, and its verification 
is of significant importance for the forthcoming large-scale quantum computing.
In this paper, we propose {\myFrameworkName}, an efficient verification framework for stabilizer codes. 
 {\myFrameworkName} first comes with a concise language, {\langname}, which incorporates  stabilizers to represent QEC programs.
Stabilizers together with stabilizer expressions are also used as predicates in our new assertion language, {\assnname}. 
We then derive a sound quantum Hoare logic to efficiently reason about the correctness of QEC programs.
Finally, We evaluate  {\myFrameworkName} by a theoretical complexity analysis and case studies on two QEC codes.
We believe this work will spark more interest in the verification of QEC programs which may become a prevalent programming paradigm in the near future.
